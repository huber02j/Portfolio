							<h3>Project Overview</h3>
							<p>BOSCO Uganda has partnered with UNICEF to deploy digital doorways in refugee camps and schools
								throughout rural areas in northern Uganda. The digital doorway consists of three distinct laptop computers
								that are powered by a solar charged battery system. All of this is contained within a kiosk station which allows
								three users to work at any time.</p>
							<p>In order to improve these systems, BOSCO Uganda needs to collect information about the users’ demographics and
								application use to ensure that the digital doorways are being utilized by each demographic for educational purposes.
								Since the system contains only one user account that everyone logs in and uses, it is difficult to know who is using
							 	the system, how often they are using the system, and what applications they are using. The team, led by Jacob Huber,
								has created a simple Windows desktop application that will appear immediately as a user logs into the machine and every
								thirty minutes following to reach every user. The application will require the user to login or create an account,
								depending on if they are a first-time user. Basic information about demographics will be collected, stored within
								a database, and accessible to BOSCO Uganda. In addition to the demographics collection, the team has developed
								python scripts that will run intermittently as background processes to collect the names of applications the user
								is running. The applications which will be recorded are those open in the main taskbar at the bottom of the screen,
								such as Google Chrome or Microsoft Word. The application and background monitoring require minimal user interaction
								ensuring project success regardless of the user’s prior technological knowledge. </p>
							<p>The installation of these systems has already begun with the first two deployments being at Pagirinya Secondary
								School – a school created specifically to serve the South Sudanese refugee community and other residents of the
								surrounding Pagirinya area – and St. Mary’s Assumpta Secondary School. In a few months, BOSCO Uganda will be able
								to collect and analyze this information in order to find trends regarding how the computers are used in order to
								improve resources available to refugees and students.</p>

							<h3>Background Monitor Python Scripts</h3>
							<p>I developed two python scripts that run intermittently as background processes to collect the
								names of applications the user is running. The applications which will be recorded are those
								open in the main taskbar at the bottom of the screen, such as Google Chrome or Microsoft Word.
								The application and background monitoring require minimal user interaction ensuring project
								success regardless of the user’s prior technological knowledge. </p>
							<p>The first script is broken down into 3 different categories</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Connect to SQL Server and acquire contents	</li>
								<li>Run powershell commands to find apps running
									<br>
									The powershell script produces the following information when run:</li>
								<li>Lastly, add application to database if it is not already there.</li>
								<p>The second python script works very similarly. It connects to the database,
								extracts the name of the current user, and then links the name to the applications
								being used. This is very helpful because it allows BOSCO to be able to find data on
								a specific demographic or age range. </p>
								<li>The main change in code is the addition of a section
								to get the name in order to link it.</li>

					<h3>Instruction Manual</h3>
					<p>Along the process I collected resources and information on the materials that
					are needed to install and run the entire project successfully. One major componenet of the
					project is that it has and will continue to be deployed at computer centers that do not
					have access to the internet. As a result, all of the things that are needed to run the
					project, such as python libraries for SQL Databases, need to be downloaded online and made
					available to take offline. The instruction manual that I created centers around a folder
					that I designed to contain everything that the user needs in order to install the system. </p>
